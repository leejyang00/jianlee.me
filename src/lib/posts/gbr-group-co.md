This is my first client-based project, developing a corporate website for GBR Group Co., designed to showcase their holdings, partnerships, product distribution, and market share across the ASEAN region.

Kinn, the founder, approached me with the vision of creating a static website that embodies professionalism, credibility, and a strong corporate presence. The goal was to establish GBR Group Co. as a trusted industry leader, reinforcing its brand identity through a sleek, modern, and minimalistic design.

**Website:** [www.gbrgroupco.com](https://kitsui-v2.pages.dev/)  
**Stack:** Vite, React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Shadcn UI, Material UI, Cloudflare
