# Pacemates Run Club

From an ideation to reality. This was one of my favourite projects that I've done, so much so that it was out of my comfort zone.

## Background

My journey began back in 2020 when Covid hit, couldn't do much exercise with places restricted or high risk to exposure. My only available options was running. Plus, I was pretty active in Strava previously for my road cycling adventures, so what other ways to gamify it! Fast forward to 2023, when my good friend, Ethan, introduced me the ideation of running a marathon. 42.2 km.

"You're insane", I told him.

"Where?" To which he replied, "Sydneyâ€¦"

"So I'm gonna be running the longest distance I've had, plus in one of the prettiest city in the world?" If you know me well enough, I'm always up for a challenge. "COUNT ME IN!", I said.

## Why

Why a run club? Because I've been running alone and I want to build a community. You know that saying, **"If you wanna go fast, go alone. If you wanna go far, go TOGETHER."** Plus, it's hard these days finding the kind of people that fits into your social group. I wanted to meet new people in the community area that has similar interest. So instead of searching for them, I'll bring them to me :)

## Journey

We started off in October 2023. It was fresh, we were excited, called in a few friends, plus friends of friends, to join us in our runs.

Questions: Whats the best time to run? What day should it be? How bout running it twice a week to cater to cater both students and working adults? What should be the right distance? What's the route gonna be? What are the sequence of events that should be days before the run, on the run day, and after, to keep our member highly engaged to wanna come back?

All these questions, I had to answer...

so, every Tuesdays @ 7pm, Southbank Brisbane. 5km easy pace run. "easy"â€¦

We started off from 3 to 5 runners per week, and once word got out, we were peaking around 15 runners in a week. I know, 172 IG followers, 3000+ views on reels, 30+ members in our Strava club, I thought we would have at least 20+ runners per week am I right? Unfortunately that reality didn't came. But I'm always grateful for the ones that made time coming out on a weekday night running with a guy that's chasing his dreams. I brought in a few friends to help out with the club.

We have Instagram, WhatsApp group, Strava club to give updates, plus a website that never got used to it's fullest potential. We had all the social reachability as much as we could, yet, the numbers weren't peaking as much as we thought we could. And did you know we've got a merch? Pacemates Run Club merch. Shopify store, online purchase + delivery, our communities running all in our merch... [it was all a dream]

What really happened was, a POC shirt, bought 6 of them from a local supplier. Dollars spent, $240. Dollars earned, $0. Profit -$240. Here's one of my last marathon I did where i wore the merch.

## Learnings

The best thing about running your own club is meeting new people. Every week it was almost always a surprise to have new runners joining us, when I thought the worsts of having just me. I think finding the right people to run a club together is important too, to have the right goals and mindset, especially with similar interests. Throughout my journey, I wouldn't have done it without my friends that have helped me along the way. Their guidance, support, commitment, and advice, truly shape the club as how it went.

Would I do this again? Propably not, just cuz my focus is elsewhere now. Do I regret running the club? Never. The numerous people I've met, learnings through the should do/not do, priceless in my eyes. Lessons learned only through doing.

## Closing

Unfortunately it ended on July 2024, I was retiring the club as the people joining our weekly runs were stagnating, friends that helped me had other commitments, I was left mostly alone running the social media space. I've decided to close the club, and ended the journey.

Nevertheless, this won't be my last projects. See you in the next one ðŸ˜„ !

**Thanks to:** Henry, Kinn, Steven, Sandeep, Dino, Eleesha, Edison and all my friends + strangers I've met and helped out. You know who you are ðŸ˜‰
