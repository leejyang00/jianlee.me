            My journey began back in 2020 when Covid hit, couldn‚Äôt do much
            exercise with places restricted or high risk to exposure. My only
            available options was running. Plus, I was pretty active in Strava
            previously for my road cycling adventures, so what other ways to
            gamify it! Fast forward to 2023, when my good friend, Ethan,
            introduced me the ideation of running a marathon. 42.2 km.
          </div>
          <br />
          ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre insane‚Äù, I told him.
          <br />
          ‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù To which he replied, ‚ÄúSydney‚Ä¶‚Äù
          <br />
          "So I‚Äôm gonna be running the longest distance I‚Äôve had, plus in one of
          the prettiest city in the world?" If you know me well enough, I‚Äôm
          always up for a challenge. "COUNT ME IN!", I said.

          <div className="font-bold text-lg mb-2 uppercase">why</div>
          <div className="indent-4">
            Why a run club? Because I‚Äôve been running alone and I want to build
            a community. You know that saying,{' '}
            <span className="font-bold italic">
              ‚ÄúIf you wanna go fast, go alone. If you wanna go far, go
              TOGETHER.‚Äù
            </span>{' '}
            Plus, it‚Äôs hard these days finding the kind of people that fits into
            your social group. I wanted to meet new people in the community area
            that has similar interest. So instead of searching for them, I‚Äôll
            bring them to me :)

            We started off in October 2023. It was fresh, we were excited,
            called in a few friends, plus friends of friends, to join us in our
            runs.
            <br />
            <br />
            <div className="indent-4">
              Questions: Whats the best time to run? What day should it be? How
              bout running it twice a week to cater to cater both students and
              working adults? What should be the right distance? What‚Äôs the
              route gonna be? What are the sequence of events that should be
              days before the run, on the run day, and after, to keep our member
              highly engaged to wanna come back?

            All these questions, I had to answer...

            <br />
            so, every Tuesdays @ 7pm, Southbank Brisbane. 5km easy pace run.

              We started off from 3 to 5 runners per week, and once word got
              out, we were peaking around 15 runners in a week. I know, 172 IG
              followers, 3000+ views on reels, 30+ members in our Strava club, I
              thought we would have at least 20+ runners per week am I right?
              Unfortunately that reality didn‚Äôt came. But I‚Äôm always grateful
              for the ones that made time coming out on a weekday night running
              with a guy that‚Äôs chasing his dreams. I brought in a few friends
              to help out with the club.

            We have Instagram, WhatsApp group, Strava club to give updates, plus
            a website that never got used to it‚Äôs fullest potential. We had all
            the social reachability as much as we could, yet, the numbers
            weren‚Äôt peaking as much as we thought we could. And did you know
            we‚Äôve got a merch? Pacemates Run Club merch. Shopify store, online
            purchase + delivery, our communities running all in our merch... [it
            was all a dream]
            <br />
            <br />
            What really happened was, a POC shirt, bought 6 of them from a local
            supplier. Dollars spent, $240. Dollars earned, $0. Profit -$240.
            Here‚Äôs one of my last marathon I did where i wore the merch.

            The best thing about running your own club is meeting new people.
            Every week it was almost always a surprise to have new runners
            joining us, when I thought the worsts of having just me. I think
            finding the right people to run a club together is important too, to
            have the right goals and mindset, especially with similar interests.
            Throughout my journey, I wouldn‚Äôt have done it without my friends
            that have helped me along the way. Their guidance, support,
            commitment, and advice, truly shape the club as how it went.

            <div className="indent-4">
              Would I do this again? Propably not, just cuz my focus is
              elsewhere now. Do I regret running the club? Never. The numerous
              people I‚Äôve met, learnings through the should do/not do, priceless
              in my eyes. Lessons learned only through doing.

            Unfortunately it ended on July 2024, I was retiring the club as the
            people joining our weekly runs were stagnating, friends that helped
            me had other commitments, I was left mostly alone running the social
            media space. I‚Äôve decided to close the club, and ended the journey.
